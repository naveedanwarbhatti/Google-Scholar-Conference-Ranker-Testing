# Google Scholar Conference Ranker (CORE Edition)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Instantly see CORE conference rankings directly on Google Scholar profile pages! Essential for researchers in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and related fields.**

This Chrome extension enhances your Google Scholar experience by automatically fetching and displaying [CORE Conference Rankings](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) for publications. It helps you quickly assess the prestige of conference venues without leaving the Scholar page.

You can also install the extension directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/egohghgpljdhkmcmllhncfndmkeilpfb?utm_source=item-share-cb).


### Why?

Google Scholar is great at collecting publications but **terrible at showing the prestige of conference venues**—a crucial signal in CS and EE. This add‑on pulls the official **CORE 2023 (and also historical)** list and surfaces each publication’s tier directly in the interface.

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 **Historical Matching** | Selects the appropriate CORE ranking list (2023, 2021, 2020, 2018, 2017, 2014) based on the publication's year. Applies multiple heuristics for matching. |
| 🏷 **Rank badges**        | A\*, A, B, C colour‑coded inline next to each paper title, reflecting the historical rank.                                                |
| 📊 **Summary panel**      | Totals for A\*, A, B, C, N/A papers on the profile, aggregated across all processed publications.                                         |
| 🧹 **Name cleanup**       | Trailing titles like "PhD" or "Dr." are removed before DBLP lookup for better matches. |


## Quick Install

1.  **Download or Clone:**
    *   **Option A (Download ZIP):** Download the latest [release](https://github.com/naveedanwarbhatti/Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker/releases/download/v1.2.0/Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker-v1.2.0.zip). or click on the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
	
    *   **Option B (Clone with Git):** If you have Git installed, clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/naveedanwarbhatti/Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker.git
        ```
        The `dist/content.js` file (the compiled JavaScript) is included in the repository.

2.  **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
    *   Open Google Chrome.
    *   Navigate to `chrome://extensions` (or by clicking Menu -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions).
    *   Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle switch, usually found in the top-right corner.
    *   Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears (usually on the top-left).
    *   Select the **root directory** of the extension (the folder where `manifest.json` is located, e.g., the `Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker` folder you downloaded/cloned).

3.  **Verify:**
    *   The "Google Scholar Conference Ranker" should now appear in your list of extensions and be enabled.
    *   Navigate to a Google Scholar profile page (e.g., `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=...`). The extension should automatically run. You should see the progress bar, then the summary panel, and ranks next to papers.




## Limitations & Troubleshooting

* **DBLP coverage** – Papers missing from DBLP are not counted in the summary.
* **Short papers** – Conference papers under six pages are excluded as short papers.
* **Name mismatches** – DBLP may list your papers under a different name, leading to profile mismatches.
* **Tips**
  * Verify your DBLP profile is correct and matches your Scholar name.
  * Report mismatches or missing venues using the "Report Bug" link.
