**Instantly see CORE conference rankings directly on Google Scholar profile pages! Essential for researchers in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and related fields.**

This Chrome extension enhances your Google Scholar experience by automatically fetching and displaying [CORE Conference Rankings](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) for publications. It helps you quickly assess the prestige of conference venues without leaving the Scholar page.

You can also install the extension directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/egohghgpljdhkmcmllhncfndmkeilpfb?utm_source=item-share-cb).


### Why?

Google¬†Scholar is great at collecting publications but **terrible at showing the prestige of conference venues**‚Äîa crucial signal in CS and EE. This add‚Äëon pulls the official **CORE¬†2023 (and also historical)** list and surfaces each publication‚Äôs tier directly in the interface.

2.  **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
    *   Open Google Chrome.

## Limitations & Troubleshooting

* **DBLP coverage** ‚Äì Papers missing from DBLP are not counted in the summary.
* **Short papers** ‚Äì Conference papers under six pages are excluded as short papers.
* **Name mismatches** ‚Äì DBLP may list your papers under a different name, leading to profile mismatches.
* **Tips**
  * Verify your DBLP profile is correct and matches your Scholar name.
  * Report mismatches or missing venues using the "Report Bug" link.
